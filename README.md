For many years I used a drum sequencer inside of my music software, which I have used for over a decade. To further familiarize myself with React, I decided to attempt to create a working Drum Sequencer, complete with BPM (speed) adjustment. This was my first solo-project and it was an incredibly insightful learning experience. 

Front-End: React, Javascript, Css
